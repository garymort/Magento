About Me

[Slide 2a]My name is Ledian Hymetllari. I’ve been a PHP programmer for [longest reasonable time frame..include any work/experimentation/classes from school] years.   I have been working with Magento for about a year now  and have experience with both Magento 1 and Magento 2.  

[Slide 2b]  I am currently employed at Shero Designs - a [fluff to describe company] specializing in Magento Website implementation and maintenance.   [Slide 2c] During my time at Shero Designs I have particpated in over X new website deployments as well as over Y site upgrades for over 20 magento websites.  Of those deployments I have led the deployment [of W websites and] the deployment of Z site upgrades.

[Slide 2d]  At Shero designs I’ve worked on a number of exciting projects.  Among them I have worked on the website for [2 companies well known in Albania].   I have worked on [short summary of some project] for [Companies name] website.   [Repeat up to 3 times with different projects from different websites].  

In addition I am available for freelance consultation on small projects involving Magento and Wordpress.


Slide 3a,b,c
Slide 3a:   Ecommerce is hard!  Configuring Email.  Account Security.   Payment processing.  Custimization for products.
Slide 3b:  Magento!  Open Source!  Simple configuration for many payment processors built in.  User Security out of the box.  Extensive product customization.  Customizable.
[slide 3c]  Magento customization.  Over X extensions for Magento 1.  [url to store].  Open source allows custom functionality to be written.   High learning curve for programming.	
eCommerce Is very involved to implement properly.
[slide 3a]eCommerce Websites  in general includes many hidden pitfalls.  Configures e-mail properly - ensuring user account security and setting up/configured payment processing are all hurdles to overcome.  Moreover, many products require specialized functionality which cannot be handled with a one size fits all product.
 
[slide 3b]  Magento provides solutions for many of these issues.  It includes a large number of payment processors so they can be configured easily.  In addition, using the EAV system allows for extensive 
product customization.   Since it is open source, you have full access to the source code so it’s functionality can be extended and enhanced.

[Slide 3c]  Magento customization.  There are over X extensions available for Magento 1 from third parties on their extension store.  In addition you can have custom extensions written for your specific needs.   Finding well designed extensions can be time consuming!  In addition,  while it is possible to write enhancements using PHP - programming for Magento has a high learning curve.  Implementing my first Magento website took over 2 months.  Depending on site complexity, at Shero Designs it can take from 2 weeks to 4 months from starting implementation till the  launch of a Magento based website.







Slide 9 :  Magento is the most popular platform.  Millions[???] of small and midsized online stores.  Also used by many [major/international/big?] companies.  First company[link to site]  Second company[link to site]  Third company[link to site] 


[Slide 9] Magento has the distinction of being the MOST popular  e-commerce solution.  Magento is run by 26% of online stores - compared to it’s nearest competitors X - percentage, Y - percentage, Z - percentage.  Millions of small and midsized companies use Magento for their online store.  In addition some of the biggest brands including [pick THREE - Samsung, Fort, Fox Connect, Levono, Olympus, Men’s Health, Vizio, Nestle Nespresso and Nike] use Magento and so do millions of small and midsized ecommerce companies around the globe.



Slide 10:  Scalability.  Enhanced caching.  Clustering.  Multiple Stores.  Multi-lingual.
#4. Highly Scalable
[Slide 10] Magento can scale as your company grows.  While your initial implementation can be simple - it includes many advanced features which can enabled when you need them.  This includes extensive caching options to increase performance as your site’s popularity grows.  Built in support for clustering when you outgrow a single server.   The ability to serve multiple websites with a single installation - for example your retail store and a wholesale store.   
The Magento code is written in english.  In addition, the default installation will be in english.  Despite this, Magento has built in support for using multiple languages on your website.  There is support for over 3,800 languages -  including Albanian, Italian, and Greek!

Slide 11:  Questions?   Thank you for your time.   Further Questions:  Your contact info
Closing
[Slide 11]If there is anything you would like me to review, I’ll now take up to 15 minutes to go over it.  Any questions?
[15 minutes.  Any complicated question that will take more then 3 minutes to answer do not answer!  Instead, write down a quick note summarizing the question for yourself.  At the same time answer with “That is a bit more involved and requires too much time to address now.
